"""Focus stacking (Laplacian pyramid fusion) module copied into `bokeh_rendering_and_focus_stacking_suite/`.

This package is a vendored copy of the implementation from
`Laplacian-Pyramid-Based-Focus-Stacking/core/` in this workspace, adapted so
that:
- input datasets live under `bokeh_rendering_and_focus_stacking_suite/Imgs/focus_stacking/`
- caches / outputs live under `bokeh_rendering_and_focus_stacking_suite/outputs/focus_stacking/`
